# ESP32-S3-0.42OLED Webserver Demo

This demo shows how to setup a small webserver that connects via WiFi to a network.
After connection it displays the IP address on the OLED display.
Being in the same network, you can connect to the webpage and push some buttons.
The OLED display then shows which button you have pressed on the webpage.

This demo can be used to implement some IOT tiny devices with a webfrontend while 
still having a little status display on the device itself.

# Howto compile and deploy
I was using MS Visual Code and PlatformIO extension for it. See various tutorials on 
howto start with both.
